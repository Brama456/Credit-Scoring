This project focuses on building a Credit Scoring Classifier using machine learning techniques.
It takes a dataset of customer information and predicts their credit rating category.
Steps:
  Data loading from Excel
  Preprocessing (label encoding for the target, one-hot encoding for categorical features)
  Model training using XGBoostClassifier
  Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

The goal is to provide a reliable credit rating prediction system that can assist financial institutions in assessing credit risk with high accuracy.
